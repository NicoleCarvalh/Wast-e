        <section id="text">
        <p>  A‚ÄØlog√≠stica reversa‚ÄØde eletroeletr√¥nicos do Brasil vem ganhando for√ßa com a inaugura√ß√£o de Centrais de Log√≠stica Reversa em 24 capitais e no Distrito Federal, uma parceria da ABREE ‚Äì Associa√ß√£o Brasileira de Reciclagem de Eletroeletr√¥nicos e Eletrodom√©sticos com o poder p√∫blico e parceiros, de diferentes regi√µes do Brasil. <br/><br/>

        A implementa√ß√£o e gest√£o do processo de log√≠stica reversa visa garantir a destina√ß√£o final ambientalmente correta a 100% dos produtos p√≥s-consumo descartados pela popula√ß√£o.<br/><br/>
            
        As primeiras capitais a implementarem a central e come√ßarem a fazer parte do sistema de log√≠stica reversa de eletroeletr√¥nicos em 2021 foram Campo Grande, em junho, Florian√≥polis em julho, Vit√≥ria em agosto, Manaus, Macei√≥ e Distrito Federal em setembro, Curitiba e Rio de Janeiro em outubro, Goi√¢nia em novembro e, Porto Alegre e Porto Velho em dezembro. <br/><br/>
            
        J√° em 2022, a ABREE inaugurou centrais em Aracaju, Cuiab√°, Boa Vista e Macap√° em abril e Bel√©m, Palmas, Jo√£o Pessoa, S√£o Lu√≠s, Rio Branco e Teresina, em maio e Belo Horizonte, S√£o Paulo, Salvador e Natal em junho. <br/><br/>
            
        A maioria das centrais tem capacidade de armazenar cerca de 5 a 8 toneladas de res√≠duos eletroeletr√¥nicos descartados pela popula√ß√£o local. Ap√≥s o recebimento e armazenamento, os parceiros da ABREE retiram os produtos e encaminham para a f√°brica de manufatura reversa, que realiza a desmontagem dos equipamentos para a destina√ß√£o ambientalmente adequada. <br/><br/>
            
        ‚ÄúAs inaugura√ß√µes das centrais nas capitais representam um marco importante para log√≠stica reversa no Brasil, j√° que o objetivo √© garantir que funcionem como ponto de recebimento de res√≠duos eletr√¥nicos que s√£o depositados em coletores espalhados Brasil afora‚Äù, conta Sergio de Carvalho Mauricio, presidente da ABREE. <br/><br/>
            
            
        O trabalho da entidade tem sido de desenvolver a chamada log√≠stica reversa, em um processo que come√ßa com a educa√ß√£o ambiental, conscientizando o consumidor sobre a import√¢ncia do‚ÄØdescarte adequado‚ÄØdesses materiais para dar in√≠cio √† log√≠stica reversa. <br/><br/>
            
        Hoje, a ABREE, junto aos seus parceiros do ecossistema, contabiliza quase 3,7 mil pontos de recebimento espalhados pelo Brasil, estando presente em‚ÄØmais de 1,2 mil munic√≠pios brasileiros.‚ÄØSegundo dados divulgados pelo Minist√©rio do Meio Ambiente, foram recebidas cerca de 1,2 mil toneladas de res√≠duos eletroeletr√¥nicos e eletrodom√©sticos em 2021, 75 vezes mais do que o arrecadado nos tr√™s anos anteriores. <br/><br/>

            
        ‚ÄúAs centrais ainda trazem algumas vantagens: criam empregos, preservam os recursos naturais, evitam a polui√ß√£o, contribuem para a redu√ß√£o do consumo de energia el√©trica e √°gua, e para a diminui√ß√£o das emiss√µes dos gases de efeito estufa‚Äù, explica o presidente da ABREE. <br/><br/>
            
        No site da ABREE √© poss√≠vel‚ÄØencontra os pontos de recebimento mais pr√≥ximos por meio de buscas com o‚ÄØCEP residencial, al√©m de uma lista completa de quais produtos podem ser descartados. S√£o alguns exemplos: batedeira, ferro el√©trico, fone de ouvido, liquidificador, m√°quina de costura, micro-ondas, geladeira, purificador de √°gua, televis√£o, entre outros. <br/>
